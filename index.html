							<p>"It's hard to survive in the province." I've heard this sentence from a lot of people. I wondered if this notion have some truth to it so I looked at some data.</p>
							<p> Survival in its literal sense means not to die. This analysis focuses on the death rates. I researched some data about deaths and population from PSA. I've also included the Gross Regional Product (GRP) as it's an indirect indicator if jobs are available in that region.
								Assuming that having jobs means higher survival rate.</p>
							
							<p> I first looked at the GRP of the regions through the Bar chart. The top 3 Regions based on GRP are NCR, Region 4A and Region 3 - the center of the Philippines. I then plotted the correlation between the GRP and the death rate (total no. of deaths/ total no. of population). 
								The assumption is higher GRP means lower death rate.  There isn't a clear positive correlation (the values don't fit any trend line) but generally it shows higher GRP, higher death rate.  Lastly I plotted the map of the Philippines to see the geographical relationships of the regions and provinces with their population and death data. 
								Provinces with Metropolitan areas shows higher death rate than its neighbors.  </p>
							
							<p> All in all the notion "It's hard to survive in the province." seems unlikely to be true. But this analysis is not conclusive. There are still a lot of unaccounted factors such as income class, quality of living, lifestyles and etc. This data set is also quite small (specific for year 2016 only).
								Lastly the term survival can mean different for every person.</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" width="1000"/></a>

							<p>My name is as unique as my work experience and background. I came from a science high school and was torn to take an Engineering course or Architecture in college.
							I took the latter to fulfill my childhood dream. Before getting into college I never really draw and I don't consider myself as an artistic person. 
							It is still fascinating to me that I survived college and even passed the licensure exam.</p>
							<p>While working in architecture firms and jobs, I find myself questioning my life choices. It felt like I'm meant to do something else.
							So when my former boss offered me a job different from Architecture, I immediately grabbed the opportunity. I became an Operations Manager which deals with the system of the company.
							The job fits my personality of being logical and being a planner. In that job I came upon loads of underutilized company data. 
							I wondered what the data mean and how to utilize it. That is how I've known about Data Science.</p>
							<p>I became interested in the field and started self studying. It brought back happy memories of being a math nerd and completing computer science projects back in high school. 
							I'm not sure if Data Science is the right field for me but right now I enjoy studying, coding and doing visualizations.</p>
